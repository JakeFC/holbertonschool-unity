# The (mostly) shallow end of the pool for all things Unity

This repository contains a large cross-section of what I've worked on at Holberton for the past 7 months, most notably [3d Platformer](0x00-unity-audio) and [Vuforia Slingshot Game](0x00-unity-ar_slingshot_game).

#### About Me
I'm an AR/VR student at Holberton School interested in logical problem-solving and creating dynamic experiences. Unity has allowed me to take those experiences to the next level with its seamless integration of scripting, ui elements, physics, and animations.
