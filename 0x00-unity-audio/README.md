# 0x00. Unity - Audio

#### What is this repository?
This is the fourth and final iteration of a 3D platformer game in Unity, which adds audio effects and background music to the game, as well as volume sliders and a muffled pause effect. The [first](../0x00-unity-assets_models_textures) module centered around creating a scene with platforms and a primitive model with player-controlled movement and jumping, as well as a running timer script and win condition, triggered by reaching the end flag. Module number [two](../0x00-unity-assets_ui) raised the number of scenes to three and added home, option, and pause menus to swap between them, as well as invert the y-axis and restart or exit the game. The [third](../0x00-unity-animation) then added an intro flyover animation to the scenes, as well as replacing the player's pill with a rigged and animated model and setting up a dynamic animation loop to adapt to each of the player's states.

#### Challenges
These were mostly based around player and camera movement, as well as finding the right settings for each animation to make everything flow naturally. Specifically, the camera had to be able to rotate freely around the player and affect which direction the player should move when inputting a given direction.

#### About Me
I'm an AR/VR student at Holberton School and I'm very excited about creating dynamic experiences like this one in Unity, as well as writing the controller and event scripts that make it all work.

#### Known Bugs
- There may still be some angled assets on which the player can get permanently wedged
- Movement speed is faster the flatter your camera angle is.
